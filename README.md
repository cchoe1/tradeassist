Welcome to Trade Assist.  This software package is intended to give you enhanced trading tools for various exchanges such as GDAX and other cryptocurrency exchanges (soon to come!).  This also serves as a virtual portfolio for your current assets and gives you detailed views on your current positions, gains, losses, and trade history.  

Trade Assist is capable of syncing up to GDAX's Websocket feed and receive real-time data.  Be advised that in order to receive data for your portfolio, you will need to supply private API keys.  Take caution to conceal these keys and store them safely as API keys may or may not have the ability to make drastic changes to your account or your balances.

In order for this to work properly, please ensure that this software is running whenever you are trading on GDAX.  You can find more detailed instructions on installation below:

If you would like to contribute or fix any bugs, please fork off this repository and make your changes on a new branch and submit a pull request with that branch.

Some configuration is required.  Please check under the Installation section for more information.
